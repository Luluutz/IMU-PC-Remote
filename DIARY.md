<p>Created the Github Repo. Nothing else really.<br>
I am really excited to start adding some stuff to the repo and setting everthing up tomorrow!<br>
The plan is to write both code for the PC application (Windows for now) and the microcontroller that reads the imu data.<br>
I plan on creating the PC application with QT and QML/Widgets (not really sure how any of that works yet lol) and and the code for the microcontroller with the Arduino IDE since they support ESP chips hehe.<br>
Also, I was thinking of documenting how all the different phyisical components are to be wired together so people can recreate everything here. Not sure how to do that yet.</p>

<p>This seems to be a lot of different things to fit into a single repo so I might decide to split this up into multiple repos down the road depending on how messy it gets lol.<br>
The most important thing for me to do now before I start coding without a plan is.. to make a plan on what I need to tackle first and on what problems there are that I have to solve.<br>
Issues like, how do I get my IMU data from the microcontroller to my QT application and such (im thinking raw sockets and udp over wifi but honestly no clue).<br>
Also I wanna draw one of those fancy kindof diagrams that depict all your components and how they interact with each other (dont know the name lol)<br>
So the first step in this coding project is to establish a connection between the microcontroller and the QT application (It sounds so easy but I feel like its not)</p>

<br>Good night lol
